## Borzoi Prime - Predicting 3'-scRNA-seq coverage profiles across many cell types

This directory contains code for training and evaluating Borzoi Prime, a neural network that predicts pseudo-bulk scRNA-seq coverage profiles from DNA sequence. Pre-trained model weights and relevant data are also available and linked below.

See [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calico/borzoi-paper/main/extensions/prime/examples/targets_human.txt) for a list of human coverage profiles, and [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calico/borzoi-paper/main/extensions/prime/examples/targets_mouse.txt) for mouse coverage profiles.

### Model Availability
The model weights can be downloaded as .h5 files from the URLs below.

### Data Availability
The training data for Borzoi Prime is available on Google Cloud Storage at: [gs://prime-paper/data](gs://prime-paper/data). Users wanting to access the data should first read the data use policy, which can be found [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/seqnn-share/prime/hg38/TABULA_SAPIENS_DATA_USE_POLICY.txt). Contact *drk (at) calicolabs.com* or *jlinder (at) calicolabs.com* for questions on how to access the data.

*Note*: This data bucket is large (multiple TB) and thus set to "Requester Pays". To access the bucket, you must have a billable user project set up on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and included with the "-u" flag when issuing gCloud CLI commands.

A sample dataset containing a small number of tracks is freely available for download [here](https://github.com/calico/borzoi-paper/tree/main/extensions/prime/sample_data).
